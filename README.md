A simple game using the pygame module

I recently worked on a game development project using the pygame module. I made this project for fun and I think it is suitable for those who want to start working with this module. You may also be able to use this project as a guide for building school or university course projects.
Steps of use:
1- Be sure to install Python version 3 and the pygame module.
2- Clone or download this project.
3. Run the game.py file.
have fun!
