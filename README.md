<h1>A simple game using the pygame module</h1>

<p>I recently worked on a game development project using the pygame module. I made this project for fun and I think it is suitable for those who want to start working with this module. You may also be able to use this project as a guide for building school or university course projects.
Steps of use:</p>
<hr>
  <h4>1- Be sure to install Python version 3 and the pygame module.</h4>
  <h4>2- Clone or download this project.</h4>
  <h4>3- Run the game.py file.</h4>
have fun!
